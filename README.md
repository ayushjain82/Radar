# Radar 🛡️

> **Interactive RAID Log & Risk Manager**

Radar is a modern, visual tool for tracking project **Risks, Assumptions, Issues, and Dependencies (RAID)**. Unlike hidden spreadsheets, Radar uses an interactive Kanban board to make risks visible, manageable, and collaborative.

## ✨ Key Features

* **📋 Kanban Workflow:** Organize risks by status (*New, Monitoring, Mitigating, Closed*).
* **🐉 Drag-and-Drop:** Intuitively move risk cards across columns as they progress.
* **🚦 Visual Risk Scoring:** Automatic color-coding and badges for **Probability** and **Impact** (High/Medium/Low).
* **⚡ Quick Capture:** Fast modal interface to log new items without losing context.
* **🔦 Focus Mode:** High-probability risks are highlighted with distinct red borders for immediate visibility.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (v18+)
* **Build Tool:** Vite
